## Don't Just Start Coding...
There are three parts to writing code:

1. Managing it
2. Documenting it
3. Writing it

Notice that writing comes *last*.

## Managing Code

> Why can't we write code the same way that we write an essay?

Version control allows us to:

1. Track changes to files with a high level of detail using `commit`.
2. `push` these changes out so that they are shared with others.
3. `pull` down made by others down to our own computers.
4. `merge` and resolve conflicting changes.
5. Create and delete a `tag` as 'milestones' are reached.
6. Create and merge a `branch` as 'features' are added/removed.
7. Retrieve particular versions or branches using a `checkout`.
